This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

### [Blog 1 - Accelerate Ethereum synchronization time with storage-optimized Amazon EC2 instances](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces how to speed up the synchronization of an Ethereum node using AWS EC2. By combining **i8g storage-optimized instances** for fast sync, **Amazon EBS** for data portability, and **r8g memory-optimized instances** for steady-state operation, the solution reduces synchronization time to only ~8 hours while keeping costs low. It also explains how Geth (Snap Sync) and Lighthouse (Checkpoint Sync) ensure security, provides implementation steps, performance analysis, and cost considerations—making it a practical guide for running Ethereum nodes efficiently on AWS.


### [Blog 2 - Migrating from Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Claude 4 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog explains how to migrate from the deprecated **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** model to **Claude 4 Sonnet** on Amazon Bedrock. It highlights the key differences, including a larger **1M-token context window**, built-in **extended reasoning**, and **parallel tool use**. The article provides updated API examples, guidance on prompt engineering, and shows how **extended thinking** improves reasoning accuracy. It also covers evaluation, safety testing with **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails**, and deployment strategies such as **shadow testing, A/B testing, and canary rollout**. The migration ensures both **service continuity** and access to the latest AI capabilities.


###  [Blog 3 - ...](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog introduces how to start building a data lake in the healthcare sector by applying a microservices architecture. You will learn why data lakes are important for storing and analyzing diverse healthcare data (electronic medical records, lab test data, medical IoT devices…), how microservices help make the system more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. The article also guides you through the steps to set up the environment, organize the data processing pipeline, and ensure compliance with security & privacy standards such as HIPAA.
